## Recommended usage

Use these chatmodes as a quick-start for common project tasks. Pick the one that matches your goal.

1. Readme generator
   - `readme-generator` — create or improve your project's `README.md`.

2. Product requirements
   - `prd-assistant` — write a clear Product Requirements Document (PRD).

3. Feature design & documentation
   - `feature-documenter` — design new features or document existing ones.

4. Implementation planning
   - `implementation-planner` — create a structured implementation plan with steps and timelines.

5. Critical review
   - `critical-thinker` — challenge assumptions and improve solution quality at any stage.

     Tip: after you've used the chatmode to surface issues, switch to regular agent mode and continue with the same conversation/context to ask the agent to apply improvements to your documentation or code (for example: "Use this context to rewrite the README with the changes we discussed"). This keeps the work in a single thread and speeds iteration.

### Optional helper prompts

- `suggest-awesome-github-copilot-chatmodes` — discover other chatmodes relevant to your project.
- `suggest-awesome-github-copilot-prompts` — find curated prompts you can reuse.

### After using these chatmodes

- Switch back to regular agent mode to continue development.
- Or continue with any custom chatmode you've added for your workflow.
